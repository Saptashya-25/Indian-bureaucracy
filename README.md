This repository contains two Stata do-files: 01_master and 02_IAS Cleaning. By following the instructions below, you will generate a cleaned, appended dataset that can be used for panel data analysis.

Folder Setup Step 1: Create a Master file. Create a folder where all data will be stored. This will be a "master" folder containing subfolders for different stages of the data conversion process. Inside the master folder, create the subfolders.

Step 2: IAS Cleaning file
Inside the IAS cleaning file, the data for the bureaucrat officers of India from 1950 to 2020 has been cleaned. Two different data sets have been cleaned primarily. Firstly, the profile dataset. This dataset contains the individual information of the IAS officers, including their name, origin, education, age, gender, and place to which they belong. There is information from over 13000 Indian Administrative Service(IAS) Officers of India that has been meticulously cleaned. Another dataset that has been cleaned is the experience of the IAS officers. This data contained information on the officers' postings during their entire tenure. It also contained information on the start and end dates of joining and leaving every position during their tenure as IAS. Using this dataset, I created the transfer variable. The transfer variable gives information on whether the officer was transferred or not. There are robust measures of transfers that are critically created by considering considerable definitions.

This novel dataset has been cleaned and created and can be used to answer many questions about the Indian political economy and bureaucrats.

Please refer to the working paper to learn more about the dataset and its uses in detail.
